# AI/ML Workshops

Welcome to our collection of AI/ML workshops.  These are run as a series at AWS public events, such as Lofts, Summits or Builders' Days, but can all be run independently.  They will walk you through several AI/ML offerings from AWS that you can use to build and train models or easily intergrate AI/ML features into your applications.

Below you'll find a list of events where these have been run, so please select the session that your are in so that you can see what's being run today.  Our Evangelists and SA's will work with you in these labs to help you complete the sessions.
